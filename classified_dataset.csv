Following the accident the importance of wearing PPE correctly was re-iterated to galley and restaurant teams and a visual indication was to be added to the bulkhead near the top of the escalator so that crew carrying trays could see where the escalator ends.

The pilot ladder should be secured to a strong point, independent of the pilot ladder winch reel and at deck level. - Mechanical securing of the pilot ladder winch reel - All pilot ladder winch reels should have means of preventing the winch reel from being accidentally operated as a result of mechanical failure or human error. A mechanical device or locking pin should be utilized to lock winch reels in position once the pilot ladder is lowered into position. - please check that the lifebuoy(s) in the vicinity of the transfer arrangement have a self activating light attached.

She returned to the dock and lined up for the outer passage. On entering the river the bow grounded on the edge of the shoal. Due to the vessel's length, the stern of the vessel did not clear the southern side of the dock entrance. This resulted in the vessel’s stern coming to rest on the tyre fendering on the south side of the dock entrance. Using the bow thruster, main engine, and port helm, an attempt was made to clear the shoal and lift the stern off the fendering. Though the stern lifted slightly the bow failed to move. It was evident that the vessel was wedged athwart the river. On the grounds of safety, the Master informed that they had requested the immediate assistance of a tug to aid their situation. On the prompt arrival of the tug, they directed her to push on the starboard shoulder to clear the shoal and then instructed her to push on the port quarter to safely aid the swing of the vessel. They finally asked her to push on the port bow to help maintain the vessel's position in the deeper water well away from the shoal. When heading out the vessel proceeded safely on outbound passage.

To aid the search they launched their daughter craft with two crew on board. As the daughter craft went in closer to the coast, the wave action on the beach was higher than anticipated which resulted in the daughter craft heeling over. One crew member fell overboard when the vessel heeled and the second crew member voluntarily jumped into the water, which was waist deep, to stabilize the craft and to recover the other crew member.  The two crew were unharmed and were able to reboard the craft and return to the main search and rescue vessel. They were checked over and were unharmed. The heeling event was reported to have happened due to the fact that the lights on the main vessel were not strong enough to illuminate closer into the shore and therefore the crew underestimated the size of the waves close to the shore. The sea state was assumed to be calmer than it was. ",Accident to person(s),4

The vessel proceeded on passage but then aborted to enable the vessel to go to anchorage for an engine assessment. The assessment concluded that there were no issues with the engine and the propulsion equipment was all in working order. The reason behind the power failure was due to a mistake on the part of the chief engineer who attempted to change over from one lubricating oil filter to the other, but made the change too quickly which did not allow the air to clear the chamber of the filter which subsequently resulted in a drop in lubricating oil pressure. The system then initiated a shut down due to the inbuilt safety system responding to the sudden pressure drop.

The bridge team observed that the revolutions suddenly dropped and the controls for the main engine switched to 'engine control'. Approximately two seconds later, the main engine control was ready for 'service on bridge' and the master took back control of the main engine immediately and increased to full ahead. The propulsion failure effected the vessel for no longer than 5 seconds. The reason behind the failure was that the chief engineer decided to take control of the main engine down to the engine room without informing the bridge. This was because of the cooling water and lube oil temperatures increasing towards alarm level and the chief engineer intended to set a lock on the main engine RPM to prevent overheating and main engine shut down. The Chief engineer was new on board, it was their first day after joining and the incident was attributed to their lack of familiarity with the system and spontaneous reaction to try to prevent ME overheating. The chief engineer was instructed not to take control from the bridge without informing the bridge team and a set of new thermostats were ordered for the main engine to ensure that the temperature readings were accurate. There were no injuries pollution or damage as a result of the incident and the vessel proceeded on passage without further issue. ",Loss Of Control,3

The remainder of the passage continued without further incident. No damage was confirmed on the ro-pax ferry, nor any pollution however, there was minor damage to the shroud and hull scuff marks. No pollution. It is likely that the Master thought a squall had passed so he went down from four engines to two. Another squall appeared fairly rapidly whilst the vessel was in a river and the slight delay in getting more power on resulted in the the glancing contact. ",Collision,1

The tug on aft stations was asked to change position to the accommodation block as the aft spring lines and aft breast-lines were tangled on the deck and required being slackened before being let go. As the tug moved to the accommodation, the stern of the LPG tanker came away from the berth at speed as the lines slackened, causing the aft breast-line to part. There were no injuries or damages besides the parted line.  Notes:  The main deck of the vessel was located below the jetty level, whereby the mooring lines were heading diagonally upwards instead of directing straight to the pier. One mooring line was directly dropped into the water by the lines man after lifting off the aft spring from the bollard. After the tug received the order from the pilot to shift back on the vessels stern, the Captain of the tug was following the order immediately and rapidly shifted back to the initial position, in order to be available again as fast as possible. While doing this, the Master of the tug did not consider the size ratio between the tug and the ship. The used tug was 32 m long, with a bollard pull of approx. 67 tones. While the tanker was only 87,5 m long. The used tug was oversized compared to the size of the ship. And a small tug movement produced a negative effect onto the ship. The fast position change, correlated with the back flush of the propeller of the tug and the unfavorable breast line heading, led to the breaking of the mooring line.",Damage / Loss Of Equipment,4

There were two areas available for the pilot ladder to be rigged, and the location further forward on the hull is where the flare of the bow begins so at the lower portion of the ladder, it is not flat against the hull. This arrangement is approved by SOLAS and class for the specific vessel, however the pilot raised issue with it because the ladder should have been flat against the hull for the full length. The ladder was rigged in the position further back. However, this position is not always suitable for the rigging of the pilot ladder in poor weather as it requires crew to use the crane to rig it and stand in an unprotected area.

However when they step out from wheelhouse again, to put side ropes to the ladder at the berth, the mooring rope they got ready earlier, appears to have moved a little into the area just outside wheelhouse door. When they step out they’ve put their right foot directly onto the mooring rope and their foot rolled over from the rope causing what they thought was an ankle strain. The foot was swollen and following a week off work they returned to their Dr, who in turn recommended an X-ray, where it was discovered that there was a fracture to the base ® metatarsal.

For unconfirmed reasons, the skipper left the safe buoyed channel after exiting the marina and passed over exclusion zones, dumping grounds, cable areas and towards a light house. The vessel went hard aground on the rocks near the light house. The impact of the vessel hitting the rocks carried away one of the passengers who was in the galley below deck at the time. The passenger collided with galley fittings and sustained a minor injury to their head. The vessel required a tow to be rescued from on the rocks. The delivery skipper tried unsuccessfully to get the vessel off the rocks by deploying the anchor and heaving on it. The anchor was fouled on a cable on the seabed, and the chain had to be cut. The over all damages were damage to the keel, rudder, standing rigging, mast, chain, anchor, running rigging, motor mounts and required extensive repairs. ",Grounding / Stranding,3
