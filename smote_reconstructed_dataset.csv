The ballast tank overflowed through an on deck vent, and the crew observed that there was an oily sheen around the vessel after this water went overboard. The crew stopped the ballasting and sounded all the tanks. The HFO tank adjacent to the ballast tank being filled showed that it had 3 cubic meters more in it than the previous time it was sounded. As the tide went out the vessel rested on the bottom again and the tanks were sounded again. There was no change in the soundings. The vessel crew determined that there was no exterior hull breach but that there was a suspected bulkhead breach between the ballast tank and the fuel oil tank. The amount of pollution was such that it dissipated with the ebb tide and there was no need for a pollution clean up. "

The mooring line was put into use less than a year before the incident and didn't show any signs of excessive wear and tear before the incident. No one was injured, there was no pollution and the only damage was the broken line, which parted approximately 5m above the eye. The mooring line was then turned end to end on the drum and returned to working condition. "
ORIG_3470,4,Original,A LPG tanker parted an aft breast-line whilst unmooring.,"An LPG tanker parted an aft breast-line when unmooring. The tug on aft stations was asked to change position to the accommodation block as the aft spring lines and aft breast-lines were tangled on the deck and required being slackened before being let go. As the tug moved to the accommodation, the stern of the LPG tanker came away from the berth at speed as the lines slackened, causing the aft breast-line to part. There were no injuries or damages besides the parted line.  Notes:  The main deck of the vessel was located below the jetty level, whereby the mooring lines were heading diagonally upwards instead of directing straight to the pier. One mooring line was directly dropped into the water by the lines man after lifting off the aft spring from the bollard. After the tug received the order from the pilot to shift back on the vessels stern, the Captain of the tug was following the order immediately and rapidly shifted back to the initial position, in order to be available again as fast as possible. While doing this, the Master of the tug did not consider the size ratio between the tug and the ship. The used tug was 32 m long, with a bollard pull of approx. 67 tones. While the tanker was only 87,5 m long. The used tug was oversized compared to the size of the ship. And a small tug movement produced a negative effect onto the ship. The fast position change, correlated with the back flush of the propeller of the tug and the unfavorable breast line heading, led to the breaking of the mooring line."

Once the stern of the vessel was clear of the dock, the Master was advised to engage his engine full astern and bow thrust full power to starboard. The Master carried out these manoeuvres very slowly and the vessel speed reduced accordingly. At this time the vessel's bow was still setting south with the tide at which time the pilot enquired into the anchor status – the Master replied that only one shackle on deck was deployed. The pilot advised the Master to lay more anchor into the water which was implemented. The delays in dropping anchor and full astern engine engagement severely hampered the vessels ability to swing to starboard into the tide. This resulted in the vessel's port bow making contact to the  jetty close to the ferry steps.
